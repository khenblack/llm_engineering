Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

While it's hard to single out one 'best' crate due to diverse needs (web development, data processing, machine learning, etc.), some widely-regarded ones are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **serde** - A framework for serialization/deserialization of Rust structures into and from JSON, MessagePack, Protobuf, AVRO, & more efficiently using attribute annotations like `#[derive]`. It's incredibly useful when communicating with remote services or persisting state to disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **actix** - An asynchronous web-focused library which integrates well into the standard Rust async machinery and allows you to build microservices, APIs easily: it provides routing for HTTP requests/responses based on request paths & query parameters with a concise DSL (Domain Specific Language).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **reqwest** - A highly-efficient library built around `hyper::Client` designed for networking tasks in Rust and is excellent when communicating over the web, especially building networked services like microservices or REST APIs. It supports various standards out of box including HTTP/2, TLS & more by default.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **tokio** - A multi-platform, non-blocking event library for asynchronous I/O which is a fundamental component when doing lots of concurrent networking tasks in Rust and can be considered equivalent to `async` as used commonly among NodeJS developers or Python' extranetsockets (`asyncio`).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **tokio-util** - A set of utility abstractions for Tokio, often necessary around async I/O like timers & more efficient serialization solutions with protobuf which come handy while coding in Rust’s asynchronous paradigm. \n",
      "\n",
      "As far as web frameworks are concerned:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Hyper** - A fast and flexible HTTP framework for writing your own minimalistic, yet production-ready (non threaded) server written on Hyper where you can also run async Futures with an event loop built atop Tokio/async runtime of Rust programming language. It's quite lightweight but powerful enough as it allows defining handlers to handle incoming requests directly in its DSL similar to hyper’s future-based syntax or standard HTTP library and does not require heavy libraries like rocket, warp etc\n",
      "2. **Roact** - Designed for building reactive user interfaces while providing an alternative Rust ecosystem that works well with JavaScript environments especially NodeJS (Through Neon bindings). It’s used mainly in embedded systems or as web UI frameworks if you'd like to use other parts of your application written elsewhere.\n",
      "3. **Mio** - Designed for low latency, high rates networking and message passing using Rust asynchronous primitives with event loop via Tokio Runtime: it handles connections handling lots simultaneous clients efficiently which is beneficial when dealing on I/O heavy systems like chat servers or gaming platforms etc \n",
      "4. **Rayon** - A data parallelism library that allows writing multi-threaded code in a concise, safe and efficient way using standard Rust primitives only: its useful for operations needing to process large amount of items concurrently; can be used often when performing computations over chunks or processing bulk streaming tasks.\n",
